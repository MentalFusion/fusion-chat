## Fusion Chat ##

Fusion Chat is a responsive, light-weight, and privacy-focused chat application that supports end-to-end encryption and provides no permanent storage solution.

By default, messages are ephemeral and are lost once all parties are disconnected from the client. If you so choose, messages can be stored in your browser's IndexedDB for a given duration or number of messages; messages stored in IndexedDB are restored on your next visit, but they are only visible to you.

Your chosen username and avatar are stored locally in IndexedDB, but future avatar services, like Gravatar, may be implemented.
